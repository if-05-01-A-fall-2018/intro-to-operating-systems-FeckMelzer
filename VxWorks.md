# Description of VxWorks
### History
VxWorks is a RTOS (real-time operating system) developed by Wind River Systems, a subsidiary by Intel.
It is designed for systems requiring real-time, good performance and an high amount of safety, just like aerospace companies,
defense, medical devices, industrial equipment, robotics, energy, transportation, network infrastructure and consumer electronics.

VxWorks key milestones are:
-  1980s: VxWorks adds support for 32-bit processors.
-  1990s: VxWorks 5 becomes the first[citation needed] RTOS with a networking stack.
-  2000s: VxWorks 6 supports SMP and adds derivative industry-specific platforms.
- 2010s: VxWorks adds support for 64-bit processing[5] and introduces VxWorks 7 for IoT in 2016.

### Technology
- Multitasking kernel with *roundrobin* scheduling and fast interrupt response
- It's a native 64-Bit OS (only supports 64-Bit architectures)
- Supported file systems :
  - High Reliability File System (HRFS)
  - FAT-based File System (DOSFS)
  - Network File System (NFS)
  - Flash File System FFS
- Multi OS messaging
- Runs on nearly every modern CPU used in the embedded market
